# Developer

The DeviceScript developer experience is designed to be friendly with developers familiar with TypeScript projects.
DeviceScript uses the TypeScript syntax and the developer tooling does not require any special hardware

## Visual Studio (VS) Code extension

The DeviceScript extension for VS Code provides the best developer experience, with building, deploying, debugging,
tracing, device monitoring and other developer productivity features.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is IDE agnostic and will let you script your own developer experience.

:::tip
If you are developing the C++ firmware for DeviceScript,
you will need a more traditional embedded development setup.
